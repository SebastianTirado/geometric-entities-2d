# geometric-entities-2d

(in progress)

C++ implementation of the following geometric entities:
- Point2D
- Line2D
- Region2D

Created for UF CIS4930 Geometric Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Compile and test on Linux

Before starting, you will need git and g++.
On Debian and Ubuntu, open a terminal and install both with:
```
sudo apt install git build-essential
```
(NOTE: I think UF CISE's Linux servers already have git and g++ installed, so skip this step.) 

Download this repository and enter the newly created directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/rb-uf/geometric-entities-2d
cd geometric-entities-2d
```

Compile:
```
make
```

Run the test program:
```
./test
```

It should print:
```
Test successful.
```
