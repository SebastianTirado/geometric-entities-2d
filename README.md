## How to compile and run the test program on Linux

Before starting, you will need to install git and g++.
On Debian or Ubuntu, both can be installed from the terminal with:
```
sudo apt install git build-essential
```

Download this repository and enter the newly created directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/rb-uf/geometric-entities-2d
cd geometric-entities-2d
```

Compile:
```
make
```

Run the test program:
```
./test
```

It should print out:
```
Test successful.
```
